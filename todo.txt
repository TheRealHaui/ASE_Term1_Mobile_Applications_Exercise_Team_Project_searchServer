To deploy the Spring application to glassfish this all if it is in good mood and tends to work would be necessary.

http://forum.spring.io/forum/spring-projects/roo/106107-deploying-a-roo-jpa-2-app-to-glassfish-3

Because glassfish doesnot like ressource_local persistence units - huhuhuh
It wants JTA - huhuhu
And therefore as always and ever we have to be experts in all of the related technologies to only understand
what those .......... are talking about.
Beside that we have to update around one hundert configuration bullshit xml and properties and so and so on files.
